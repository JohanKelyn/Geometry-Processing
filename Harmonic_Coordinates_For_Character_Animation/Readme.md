## Harmonic Coordinates for Character Articulation

This is a project for my geometric modeling class at the New York University. The project is based on the paper Harmonic Coordinates for Character Articulation by P. Joshy, et al.
The notebook shows a step-by-step process of how this algorithm works. Please note that I have used external libraries such as Libigl for geoemtric calculations.
