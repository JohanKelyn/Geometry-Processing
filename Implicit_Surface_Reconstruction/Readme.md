# Implicit Surface Reconstruction
<br>
In this coding problem we will:

- Compute an implicit MLS function approximating a 3D point cloud with given (but possibly unnormalized) normals.
- Sample the implicit function on a 3D volumetric grid.
- Apply the marching tets algorithm to extract a triangle mesh of this zero level set.

Note that for all this problems we will use the library libigl.
