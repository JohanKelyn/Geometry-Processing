# Mesh Parametrization

In thsi notebook, I will show how to
* Implement a Vector Field on a Surface Using Soft Constraints
* Implement a Vector Field on a Surface Using Hard Constraints
* Reconstructing a scalar field from a vector field
* Harmonic and LSCM Parameterizations
* Editing a parameterization with vector fields
