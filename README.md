# Geometry Processing
This repository contains some coding homework problems related to the geometric modeling class at NYU implemented with python and libigl. The topics are the following:
- Implicit Surface Reconstruction
- Screened Poisson Surface Reconstruction
- Normals Calculation
- Surface Bilateral Smoothing and Deformation
- Tangent Vector Field Generation
- Harmonic and LSCM Parameterizations
- Local Surface Deformation
- Harmonic Coordinates for Character Animation in 2D
